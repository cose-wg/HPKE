Use of Hybrid Public-Key Encryption (HPKE) with CBOR Object Signing and
                           Encryption (COSE)
                        draft-ietf-cose-hpke-01

Abstract

   This specification defines hybrid public-key encryption (HPKE) for
   use with CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE).  HPKE offers a
   variant of public-key encryption of arbitrary-sized plaintexts for a
   recipient public key.

   HPKE works for any combination of an asymmetric key encapsulation
   mechanism (KEM), key derivation function (KDF), and authenticated
   encryption with additional data (AEAD) encryption function.
   Authentication for HPKE in COSE is provided by COSE-native security
   mechanisms.

1.  Introduction

   Hybrid public-key encryption (HPKE) [I-D.irtf-cfrg-hpke] is a scheme
   that provides public key encryption of arbitrary-sized plaintexts
   given a recipient's public key.  HPKE utilizes a non-interactive
   ephemeral-static Diffie-Hellman exchange to establish a shared
   secret.  The motivation for standardizing a public key encryption
   scheme is explained in the introduction of [I-D.irtf-cfrg-hpke].

Internet-Draft                  COSE HPKE                   January 2022


   The HPKE specification defines several features for use with public
   key encryption and a subset of those features is applied to COSE
   [RFC8152].  Since COSE provides constructs for authentication, those
   are not re-used from the HPKE specification.  This specification uses
   the "base" mode, as it is called in HPKE specification language.

2.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This specification uses the following abbreviations and terms: -
   Content-encryption key (CEK), a term defined in CMS [RFC2630].  -
   Hybrid Public Key Encryption (HPKE) is defined in
   [I-D.irtf-cfrg-hpke].  - pkR is the public key of the recipient, as
   defined in [I-D.irtf-cfrg-hpke].  - skR is the private key of the
   recipient, as defined in [I-D.irtf-cfrg-hpke].

3.  HPKE for COSE

3.1.  Overview

   The CDDL for the COSE_Encrypt structure, as used with this
   specification, is shown in Figure 1.

   HPKE, when used with COSE, follows a three layer structure:

   o  Layer 0 (corresponding to the COSE_Encrypt structure) contains
      content (plaintext) encrypted with the CEK.  This ciphertext may
      be detached.  If not detached, then it is included in the
      COSE_Encrypt structure.

   o  Layer 1 (see COSE_recipient_outer structure) includes the
      encrypted CEK.

   o  Layer 2 (in the COSE_recipient_inner structure) contains
      parameters needed for HPKE to generate a shared secret used to
      encrypt the CEK found in layer 1.

   This three-layer structure is used to encrypt content that can also
   be shared with multiple parties at the expense of a single additional
   encryption operation.  As stated above, the specification uses a CEK
   to encrypt the content at layer 0.  For example, the content to be
   encrypted at layer 0 may be a firmware image.  Then, a single

   firmware image can be encrypted with the same CEK once while each
   recipient receives the CEK encrypted differently.

 COSE_Encrypt_Tagged = #6.96(COSE_Encrypt)

 HPKE_Encryption_Info = COSE_Encrypt_Tagged

 ; Layer 0
 COSE_Encrypt = [
   Headers,
   ciphertext : bstr / nil,
   recipients : [+COSE_recipient_outer]
 ]

 ; Layer 1
 COSE_recipient_outer = [
   protected   : bstr .size 0,
   unprotected : header_map, ; must contain alg
   encCEK      : bstr, ; CEK encrypted with HPKE-derived shared secret
   recipients  : [ + COSE_recipient_inner ]
 ]

 ; Layer 2
 COSE_recipient_inner = [
   protected   : bstr .cbor header_map, ; must contain HPKE alg
   unprotected : header_map, ; must contain kid and ephemeral public key
   empty       : null,
   empty       : null
 ]

 header_map = {
   Generic_Headers,
   * label =values,
 }

           Figure 1: CDDL for HPKE-based COSE_Encrypt Structure

   The COSE_recipient_outer structure shown in Figure 1 includes the
   encrypted CEK (in the encCEK structure) and the COSE_recipient_inner
   structure, also shown in Figure 1, contains the ephemeral public key
   (in the unprotected structure).

3.2.  HPKE Encryption with SealBase

   The SealBase(pkR, info, aad, pt) function is used to encrypt a
   plaintext pt to a recipient's public key (pkR).





Tschofenig, et al.        Expires July 21, 2022                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                  COSE HPKE                   January 2022


   IMPORTANT: For use in this specification, the plaintext "pt" passed
   into the SealBase is the CEK.  The CEK is a random byte sequence of
   length appropriate for the encryption algorithm selected in layer 0.
   For example, AES-128-GCM requires a 16 byte key and the CEK would
   therefore be 16 bytes long.

   The "info" parameter can be used to influence the generation of keys
   and the "aad" parameter provides additional authenticated data to the
   AEAD algorithm in use.  If successful, SealBase() will output a
   ciphertext "ct" and an encapsulated key "enc".  The content of enc is
   the ephemeral public key.

   The content of the info parameter is based on the 'COSE_KDF_Context'
   structure, which is detailed in Figure 2.

3.3.  HPKE Decryption with OpenBase

   The recipient will use the OpenBase(enc, skR, info, aad, ct) function
   with the enc and ct parameters received from the sender.  The "aad"
   and the "info" parameters are obtained via the context of the usage.

   The OpenBase function will, if successful, decrypt "ct".  When
   decrypted, the result will be the CEK.  The CK is the symmetric key
   used to decrypt the ciphertext in layer 0 of the COSE_Encrypt
   structure.

3.4.  Info Structure

   This specification re-uses the context information structure defined
   in [RFC8152] for use with the HPKE algorithm.  This payload becomes
   the content of the info parameter for the HPKE functions.  For better
   readability of this specification the COSE_KDF_Context structure is
   repeated in Figure 2.

      PartyInfo = (
          identity : bstr / nil,
          nonce : bstr / int / nil,
          other : bstr / nil
      )

      COSE_KDF_Context = [
          AlgorithmID : int / tstr,
          PartyUInfo : [ PartyInfo ],
          PartyVInfo : [ PartyInfo ],
          SuppPubInfo : [
              keyDataLength : uint,
              protected : empty_or_serialized_map,
              ? other : bstr
          ],
          ? SuppPrivInfo : bstr
      ]

       Figure 2: COSE_KDF_Context Data Structure for info parameter

   Since this specification may be used in a number of different
   deployment environments flexibility for populating the fields in the
   COSE_KDF_Context structure is provided.

   For better interoperability, the following recommended settings are
   provided:

   o  PartyUInfo.identity corresponds to the kid found in the
      COSE_Sign_Tagged or COSE_Sign1_Tagged structure (when a digital
      signature is used).  When utilizing a MAC, then the kid is found
      in the COSE_Mac_Tagged or COSE_Mac0_Tagged structure.

   o  PartyVInfo.identity corresponds to the kid used for the respective
      recipient from the inner-most recipients array.

   o  The value in the AlgorithmID field corresponds to the alg
      parameter in the protected structure in the inner-most recipients
      array.

   o  keyDataLength is set to the number of bits of the desired output
      value.

   o  protected refers to the protected structure of the inner-most
      array.

4.  Example

   An example of the COSE_Encrypt structure using the HPKE scheme is
   shown in Figure 3.  It uses the following algorithm combination:

   o  AES-GCM-128 for encryption of detached ciphertext in layer 0.

   o  AES-GCM-128 for encryption of the CEK in layer 1.

   o  NIST P-256 and HKDF-SHA256 as a Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM)
      in layer 2.

   The algorithm selection is based on the registry of the values
   offered by the alg parameters (in layer 0 and layer 1) as well as in
   the hpke-alg parameter in layer 2.  The hpke-alg parameter is a newly
   defined parameter registered via the IANA COSE Header Parameter
   registry defined in [RFC8152].

5.  Security Considerations

   This specification is based on HPKE and the security considerations
   of HPKE [I-D.irtf-cfrg-hpke] are therefore applicable also to this
   specification.




Tschofenig, et al.        Expires July 21, 2022                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft                  COSE HPKE                   January 2022


   HPKE assumes the sender is in possession of the public key of the
   recipient and HPKE COSE makes the same assumptions.  Some form of
   public key distribution mechanism is assumed to exist.

   Since the CEK is randomly generated it must be ensured that the
   guidelines for random number generations are followed, see [RFC8937].

   The HPKE_Encryption_Info structure shown in this document does not
   provide authentication.  Hence, the HPKE_Encryption_Info structure
   has to be used in combination with other COSE constructs, such as the
   COSE_Sign or COSE_Sign1.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA to register a new parameter, called hpke-
   alg, in the COSE Header Parameter registry defined in [RFC8152]:

   o  Name: HPKE Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) Algorithm

   o  Label: TBD1

   o  Value Type: uint

   o  Value Registry: The values in this parameter are based on the Key
      Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEMs) registry established by the HPKE
      specification [RFC8152].

   o  Description: This parameter carries information about the Key
      Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) to be used according to the HPKE
      specification.  The registry for KEMs established by [RFC8152] is
      re-used.

   o  Reference: [[TBD: This RFC]]
