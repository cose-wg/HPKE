<?line 69?>

<t>This specification defines hybrid public-key encryption (HPKE) for use with 
CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE). HPKE offers a variant of
public-key encryption of arbitrary-sized plaintexts for a recipient public key.</t>

<t>HPKE is a general encryption framework utilizing an asymmetric key encapsulation
mechanism (KEM), a key derivation function (KDF), and an Authenticated Encryption
with Associated Data (AEAD) algorithm.</t>

<t>This document defines the use of HPKE with COSE. Authentication for HPKE in COSE is
provided by COSE-native security mechanisms or by the pre-shared key authenticated
variant of HPKE.</t>

<t>Hybrid public-key encryption (HPKE) <xref target="RFC9180"/> is a scheme that 
provides public key encryption of arbitrary-sized plaintexts given a 
recipient's public key.</t>

<t>This document defines the use of the HPKE with COSE (<xref target="RFC9052"/>, <xref target="RFC9053"/>)
with the single-shot APIs defined in Section 6 of <xref target="RFC9180"/>. Multiple
invocations of Open() / Seal() on the same context, as discussed in
Section 9.7.1 of <xref target="RFC9180"/> are not supported.</t>

<section anchor="overview"><name>Overview</name>

<t>This specification supports two modes of HPKE in COSE, namely</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>HPKE Integrated Encryption mode, where HPKE is used to encrypt
the plaintext. This mode can only be used with a single recipient.
<xref target="one-layer"/> provides the details.</t>
  <t>HPKE Key Encryption mode, where HPKE is used to encrypt a
content encryption key (CEK) and the CEK is subsequently used to
encrypt the plaintext. This mode supports multiple recipients.
<xref target="two-layer"/> provides the details.</t>
</list></t>

<t>In both cases, a new COSE header parameter called 'ek' is used
to convey the content of the enc structure defined in the HPKE
specification. The enc value represents the serialized encapsulated
public key.</t>

<t>When used with HPKE, the 'ek' header parameter MUST be present in
the unprotected header and MUST contain the encapsulated key,
which is the output of the HPKE KEM. The value of 'ek' MUST be a
bstr.</t>

<t>HPKE defines several authentication modes, as described in Table 1 of <xref target="RFC9180"/>.
In COSE HPKE, only 'mode_base' and 'mode_psk' are supported. The mode is 'mode_psk' if
the 'psk_id' header parameter is present; otherwise, the mode defaults to 'mode_base'.
'mode_base' is described in Section 5.1.1 of <xref target="RFC9180"/>, which only enables encryption
to the holder of a given KEM private key. 'mode_psk' is described in Section 5.1.2 of <xref target="RFC9180"/>,
which authenticates using a pre-shared key.</t>

<section anchor="one-layer"><name>HPKE Integrated Encryption Mode</name>

<t>This mode applies if the COSE_Encrypt0 structure uses a COSE-HPKE algorithm
and has no recipient structure(s).</t>

<t>Because COSE-HPKE supports header protection, if the 'alg' parameter is present, it MUST be included
in the protected header and MUST be a COSE-HPKE algorithm.</t>

<t>Although the use of the 'kid' parameter in COSE_Encrypt0 is
discouraged by RFC 9052, this document RECOMMENDS the use of the 'kid' parameter
(or other parameters) to explicitly identify the static recipient public key
used by the sender. If the COSE_Encrypt0 structure includes a 'kid' parameter, the
recipient MAY use it to select the corresponding private key.</t>

<t>When encrypting, the inputs to the HPKE Seal operation are set as follows:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>kem_id: Depends on the COSE-HPKE algorithm used.</t>
  <t>pkR: The recipient public key, converted into an HPKE public key.</t>
  <t>kdf_id: Depends on the COSE-HPKE algorithm used.</t>
  <t>aead_id: Depends on the COSE-HPKE algorithm used.</t>
  <t>info: Defaults to the empty string; externally provided information MAY be used instead.</t>
  <t>aad: Defaults to the empty string; externally provided information MAY be used instead.</t>
  <t>pt: The raw message plaintext.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The outputs are used as follows:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>enc: MUST be placed raw into the 'ek' (encapsulated key) parameter in the unprotected bucket.</t>
  <t>ct: MUST be used as layer ciphertext. If not using detached content, this is directly placed as
ciphertext in COSE_Encrypt0 structure. Otherwise, it is transported separately and the ciphertext field is nil.
See Section 5 of <xref target="RFC9052"/> for a description of detached payloads.</t>
</list></t>

<t>If 'mode_psk' has been selected, then the 'psk_id' parameter MUST be present.
If 'mode_base' has been chosen, then the 'psk_id' parameter MUST NOT be present.</t>

<t>When decrypting, the inputs to the HPKE Open operation are set as follows:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>kem_id: Depends on the COSE-HPKE algorithm used.</t>
  <t>skR: The recipient private key, converted into an HPKE private key.</t>
  <t>kdf_id: Depends on the COSE-HPKE algorithm used.</t>
  <t>aead_id: Depends on the COSE-HPKE algorithm used.</t>
  <t>info: Defaults to the empty string; externally provided information MAY be used instead.</t>
  <t>aad: Defaults to the empty string; externally provided information MAY be used instead.</t>
  <t>enc: The contents of the layer 'ek' parameter.</t>
  <t>ct: The contents of the layer ciphertext.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The plaintext output is the raw message plaintext.</t>

<t>The COSE_Encrypt0 MAY be tagged or untagged.</t>

<t>An example is shown in <xref target="one-layer-example"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="two-layer"><name>HPKE Key Encryption Mode</name>

<t>This mode is selected if the COSE_recipient structure uses a COSE-HPKE algorithm.</t>

<t>In this approach the following layers are involved:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Layer 0 (corresponding to the COSE_Encrypt structure) contains the content (plaintext)
encrypted with the CEK. This ciphertext may be detached, and if not detached, then
it is included in the COSE_Encrypt structure.</t>
  <t>Layer 1 (corresponding to a recipient structure) contains parameters needed for 
HPKE to generate a shared secret used to encrypt the CEK. This layer conveys the 
encrypted CEK in the COSE_recipient structure using a COSE-HPKE algorithm.
The unprotected header MAY contain the kid parameter to identify the static recipient
public key that the sender has been using with HPKE.</t>
</list></t>

<t>This two-layer structure is used to encrypt content that can also be shared with
multiple parties at the expense of a single additional encryption operation.
As stated above, the specification uses a CEK to encrypt the content at layer 0.</t>

<section anchor="recipient-encryption"><name>Recipient Encryption</name>

<t>This section defines the Recipient_structure, which is used in place of COSE_KDF_Context
for COSE-HPKE recipients. It MUST be used for COSE-HPKE recipients, as it provides
integrity protection for recipient-protected header parameters.</t>

<t>The Recipient_structure is modeled after the Enc_structure defined in <xref target="RFC9052"/>,
but is specific to COSE_recipient structures and MUST NOT be used with COSE_Encrypt.</t>

<t>Furthermore, the use of COSE_KDF_Context is prohibited in COSE-HPKE; it MUST NOT be
used.</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
Recipient_structure = [
    context: "HPKE Recipient",
    next_layer_alg: int/tstr,
    recipient_protected_header: empty_or_serialize_map,
    recipient_extra_info: bstr
]
]]></artwork></figure>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>"next_layer_alg" is the algorithm ID of the COSE layer for which the COSE_recipient is encrypting a key.
It is the algorithm that the key MUST be used with.
This value MUST match the alg parameter in the next lower COSE layer.
(This serves the same purpose as the alg ID in the COSE_KDF_Context.
It also mitigates attacks where a where the attacker manipulates the content-encryption
algorithm identifier. This attack has been demonstrated against CMS and the mitigation
can be found in <xref target="I-D.ietf-lamps-cms-cek-hkdf-sha256"/>.</t>
  <t>"recipient_protected_header" contains the protected header parameters from the COSE_recipient
CBOR-encoded deterministically with the "Core Deterministic Encoding Requirements",
specified in Section 4.2.1 of RFC 8949 <xref target="STD94"/>.</t>
  <t>"recipient_extra_info" contains any additional context the application wishes to include in
the key derivation via the HPKE info parameter. If none, it is a zero-length string.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="cose-hpke-recipient-construction"><name>COSE-HPKE Recipient Construction</name>

<t>Because COSE-HPKE supports header protection, if the 'alg' parameter is present, it
MUST be in the protected header parameters and MUST be a COSE-HPKE algorithm.</t>

<t>The protected header MAY contain the kid parameter to identify the static recipient
public key that the sender used. Use of the 'kid' parameter is RECOMMENDED
to explicitly identify the static recipient public key used by the sender.
Including it in the protected header parameters ensures that it is input into the
key derivation function of HPKE.</t>

<t>When encrypting, the inputs to the HPKE Seal operation are set as follows:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>kem_id: Depends on the COSE-HPKE algorithm used.</t>
  <t>pkR: The recipient public key, converted into HPKE public key.</t>
  <t>kdf_id: Depends on the COSE-HPKE algorithm used.</t>
  <t>aead_id: Depends on the COSE-HPKE algorithm used.</t>
  <t>info: Deterministic encoding of the Recipient_structure.</t>
  <t>aad: Defaults to the empty string; externally provided information MAY be used instead.</t>
  <t>pt: The raw key for the next layer down.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The outputs are used as follows:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>enc: MUST be placed raw into the 'ek' (encapsulated key) parameter in the unprotected bucket.</t>
  <t>ct: MUST be placed raw in the ciphertext field in the COSE_recipient.</t>
</list></t>

<t>When decrypting, the inputs to the HPKE Open operation are set as follows:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>kem_id: Depends on the COSE-HPKE algorithm used.</t>
  <t>skR: The recipient private key, converted into HPKE private key.</t>
  <t>kdf_id: Depends on the COSE-HPKE algorithm used.</t>
  <t>aead_id: Depends on the COSE-HPKE algorithm used.</t>
  <t>info: Deterministic encoding of the Recipient_structure.</t>
  <t>aad: Defaults to the empty string; externally provided information MAY be used instead.</t>
  <t>ct: The contents of the layer ciphertext field.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The plaintext output is the raw key for the next layer down.</t>

<t>It is not necessary to populate recipient_aad, as HPKE inherently mitigates the classes of
attacks that COSE_KDF_Context, and SP800-56A are designed to address. COSE-HPKE use cases
may still utilize recipient_aad for other purposes as needed; however, it is generally
intended for small values such as identifiers, contextual information, or secrets. It is
not designed for protecting large or bulk external data.</t>

<t>Any bulk external data that requires protection should be handled at layer 0 using external_aad.</t>

<t>The COSE_recipient structure is computed for each recipient.</t>

<t>When encrypting the content at layer 0, the instructions in <xref section="5.3" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC9052"/> MUST be followed, including the calculation of the
authenticated data structure.</t>

<t>An example is shown in <xref target="two-layer-example"/>.</t>

<section anchor="key-representation"><name>Key Representation</name>

<t>The COSE_Key with the existing key types can be used to represent KEM private
or public keys. When using a COSE_Key for COSE-HPKE, the following checks are made:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>If the "kty" field is "AKP", then the public and private keys SHALL be the raw HPKE public and private
keys (respectively) for the KEM used by the algorithm.</t>
  <t>Otherwise, the key MUST be suitable for the KEM used by the algorithm. In case the "kty" parameter
is "EC2" or "OKP", this means the value of "crv" parameter is suitable. The valid combinations of
KEM, "kty" and "crv" for the algorithms defined in this document are shown in <xref target="ciphersuite-kty-crv"/>.</t>
  <t>If the "key_ops" field is present, it MUST include only "derive bits" for the private key
and MUST be empty for the public key.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Examples of the COSE_Key for COSE-HPKE are shown in <xref target="key-representation-example"/>.</t>

<section anchor="ciphersuite-registration"><name>Ciphersuite Registration</name>

<t>A ciphersuite is a group of algorithms, often sharing component algorithms
such as hash functions, targeting a security level.
A COSE-HPKE algorithm is composed of the following choices:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>HPKE Mode</t>
  <t>KEM Algorithm</t>
  <t>KDF Algorithm</t>
  <t>AEAD Algorithm</t>
</list></t>

<t>The "KEM", "KDF", and "AEAD" values are chosen from the HPKE IANA
registry <xref target="HPKE-IANA"/>.</t>

<t>The HPKE mode is determined by the presence or absence of the
'psk_id' parameter and is therefore not explicitly indicated in the
ciphersuite.</t>

<t>For a list of ciphersuite registrations, please see <xref target="IANA"/>. The following
table summarizes the relationship between the ciphersuites registered in this
document and the values registered in the HPKE IANA registry <xref target="HPKE-IANA"/>.</t>

<t>The following list maps the ciphersuite labels to their textual
description.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">

</list></t>

<t>As the list indicates, the ciphersuite labels have been abbreviated at least
to some extent to strike a balance between readability and length.</t>

<t>The ciphersuite list above is a minimal starting point. Additional
ciphersuites can be registered into the already existing registry.
For example, once post-quantum cryptographic algorithms have been standardized
it might be beneficial to register ciphersuites for use with COSE-HPKE.
Additionally, ciphersuites utilizing the compact encoding of the public keys,
as defined in <xref target="I-D.irtf-cfrg-dnhpke"/>, may be standardized for use in
constrained environments.</t>

<t>As a guideline for ciphersuite submissions to the IANA COSE algorithm
registry, the designated experts must only register combinations of 
(KEM, KDF, AEAD) triple that constitute valid combinations for use with
HPKE, the KDF used should (if possible) match one internally used by the
KEM, and components should not be mixed between global and national standards.</t>

<section anchor="cosekeys-for-cose-hpke-ciphersuites"><name>COSE_Keys for COSE-HPKE Ciphersuites</name>

<section anchor="sec-cons"><name>Security Considerations</name>

<t>This specification is based on HPKE and the security considerations of
<xref target="RFC9180"/> are therefore applicable also to this specification.</t>

<t>Both HPKE and HPKE COSE assume that the sender possesses the recipient's
public key. Therefore, some form of public key distribution mechanism is
assumed to exist, but this is outside the scope of this document.</t>

<t>HPKE relies on a source of randomness to be available on the device. Additionally, 
with the two layer structure the CEK is randomly generated and it MUST be
ensured that the guidelines in <xref target="RFC8937"/> for random number generation are followed.</t>

<t>HPKE in Base mode does not offer authentication as part of the HPKE KEM. In this
case COSE constructs like COSE_Sign, COSE_Sign1, COSE_Mac, or COSE_Mac0 can be
used to add authentication.</t>

<t>If COSE_Encrypt or COSE_Encrypt0 is used with a detached ciphertext then the
subsequently applied integrity protection via COSE_Sign, COSE_Sign1, COSE_Mac, 
or COSE_Mac0 does not cover this detached ciphertext. Implementers MUST ensure
that the detached ciphertext also experiences integrity protection. This is, for
example, the case when an AEAD cipher is used to produce the detached ciphertext
but may not be guaranteed by non-AEAD ciphers.</t>

      <t>This document describes a scheme for hybrid public key encryption (HPKE). This scheme provides a variant of public key encryption of arbitrary-sized plaintexts for a recipient public key. It also includes three authenticated variants, including one that authenticates possession of a pre-shared key and two optional ones that authenticate possession of a key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) private key. HPKE works for any combination of an asymmetric KEM, key derivation function (KDF), and authenticated encryption with additional data (AEAD) encryption function. Some authenticated variants may not be supported by all KEMs. We provide instantiations of the scheme using widely used and efficient primitives, such as Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key agreement, HMAC-based key derivation function (HKDF), and SHA2.</t>

      <abstract>
        <t>The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) is a data format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small code size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the need for version negotiation. These design goals make it different from earlier binary serializations such as ASN.1 and MessagePack.</t>
        <t>This document obsoletes RFC 7049, providing editorial improvements, new details, and errata fixes while keeping full compatibility with the interchange format of RFC 7049. It does not create a new version of the format.</t>

    <abstract>
      <t>Randomness is a crucial ingredient for Transport Layer Security (TLS) and related security protocols. Weak or predictable "cryptographically secure" pseudorandom number generators (CSPRNGs) can be abused or exploited for malicious purposes. An initial entropy source that seeds a CSPRNG might be weak or broken as well, which can also lead to critical and systemic security problems. This document describes a way for security protocol implementations to augment their CSPRNGs using long-term private keys. This improves randomness from broken or otherwise subverted CSPRNGs.</t>

	 <t>   This document describes enhancements to the Hybrid Public Key
   Encryption standard published by CFRG.  These include use of &quot;compact
   representation&quot; of relevant public keys, support for key-wrapping,
   and two ways to address the use of HPKE on lossy networks: a
   determinstic, nonce-less AEAD scheme, and use of a rolling sequence
   number with existing AEAD schemes.

      <abstract>
	 <t>   This document specifies the derivation of the content-encryption key
   or the content-authenticated-encryption key in the Cryptographic
   Message Syntax (CMS) using HMAC-based Extract-and-Expand Key
   Derivation Function (HKDF) with SHA-256.  The use of this mechanism
   provides protection against where the attacker manipulates the
   content-encryption algorithm identifier or the content-authenticated-
   encryption algorithm identifier.
