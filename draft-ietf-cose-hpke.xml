<t>This specification defines hybrid public-key encryption (HPKE) for use with 
CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE). HPKE offers a variant of
public-key encryption of arbitrary-sized plaintexts for a recipient public key.</t>
      <t>HPKE works for any combination of an asymmetric key encapsulation mechanism (KEM),
key derivation function (KDF), and authenticated encryption with
additional data (AEAD) function. Authentication for HPKE in COSE is
provided by COSE-native security mechanisms or by one of the authenticated
variants of HPKE.</t>
      <t>This document defines the use of the HPKE with COSE.</t>

        <name>Overview</name>
        <t>This specification supports two modes of HPKE in COSE, namely</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
            <t>HPKE Direct Encryption mode, where HPKE is used to encrypt the plaintext. This mode can only be used with a single recipient. <xref target="one-layer"/> provides the details.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>HPKE Key Encryption mode, where HPKE is used to encrypt a content encryption key (CEK) and the CEK is subsequently used to encrypt the plaintext. This mode supports multiple recipients. <xref target="two-layer"/> 
  provides the details.</t>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <t>In both cases a new COSE header parameter, called 'ek',
is used to convey the content of the enc structure defined in the HPKE
specification. "Enc" represents the serialized public key.</t>
        <t>For use with HPKE the 'ek' header parameter MUST
be present in the unprotected header parameter and MUST contain
the encapsulated key, which is output of the HPKE KEM, and it
is a bstr.</t>
        <t>For all modes, the HPKE info parameter defaults to the empty string; mutually known private information MAY be used instead. The concept of mutually known private information is defined in <xref target="NIST.SP.800-56Ar3"/> as an input to the key derivation function.</t>
        <section anchor="one-layer">
          <name>HPKE Direct Encryption Mode</name>
          <t>This mode applies if the COSE_Encrypt0 structure uses a COSE-HPKE algorithm and has no recipients.</t>
          <t>Because COSE-HPKE supports header protection, if the 'alg' parameter is present, it MUST be included
in the protected header and MUST be a COSE-HPKE algorithm.</t>
          <t>Although the use of the 'kid' parameter in COSE_Encrypt0 is
discouraged by RFC 9052, this documents RECOMMENDS the use of the 'kid' parameter
(or other parameters) to explicitly identify the static recipient public key
used by the sender. If the COSE_Encrypt0 contains the 'kid' then the recipient may
use it to select the appropriate private key.</t>
          <t>When encrypting, the inputs to the HPKE Seal operation are set as follows:</t>
          <ul spacing="normal">

          <t>This mode is selected if the COSE_recipient structure uses a COSE-HPKE algorithm.</t>
          <t>In this approach the following layers are involved:</t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>
              <t>Layer 0 (corresponding to the COSE_Encrypt structure) contains the content (plaintext)
encrypted with the CEK. This ciphertext may be detached, and if not detached, then
it is included in the COSE_Encrypt structure.</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>Layer 1 (corresponding to a recipient structure) contains parameters needed for 
HPKE to generate a shared secret used to encrypt the CEK. This layer conveys the 
encrypted CEK in the COSE_recipient structure using a COSE-HPKE algorithm.
The unprotected header MAY contain the kid parameter to identify the static recipient
public key the sender has been using with HPKE.</t>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <t>This two-layer structure is used to encrypt content that can also be shared with
multiple parties at the expense of a single additional encryption operation.
As stated above, the specification uses a CEK to encrypt the content at layer 0.</t>

            <name>Recipient Encryption</name>
            <t>This section describes the Recipient_structure.
It serves instead of COSE_KDF_Context for COSE-HPKE recipients (and possibly other COSE algorithms defined outside this document).
It MUST be used for COSE-HPKE recipients as it provides the protection for recipient protected headers.
It is patterned after the Enc_structure in <xref target="RFC9052"/>, but is specifically for a COSE_recipient, never a COSE_Encrypt.
The COSE_KDF_Context MUST NOT be used in COSE-HPKE.</t>

It is the algorithm that the key MUST be used with.
This value MUST match the alg parameter in the next lower COSE layer.
(This serves the same purpose as the alg ID in the COSE_KDF_Context.
It also mitigates attacks where a person-in-the-middle changes the following layer algorithm from an AEAD algorithm to one that is not foiling the protection of the following layer headers).</t>

If none, it is a zero-length string.
This is distinct from the external_aad for the whole COSE encrypt.
It is per-recipient.

      <t>The "Mode" indicator may be populated with the following values from
Table 1 of <xref target="RFC9180"/>:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>
          <t>"Base" refers to "mode_base" described in Section 5.1.1 of <xref target="RFC9180"/>,
which only enables encryption to the holder of a given KEM private key.</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>"PSK" refers to "mode_psk", described in Section 5.1.2 of <xref target="RFC9180"/>,
which authenticates using a pre-shared key.</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>"Auth" refers to "mode_auth", described in Section 5.1.3 of <xref target="RFC9180"/>,
which authenticates using an asymmetric key.</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>"Auth_Psk" refers to "mode_auth_psk", described in Section 5.1.4 of <xref target="RFC9180"/>,
which authenticates using both a PSK and an asymmetric key.</t>
        </li>

      <t>As the list indicates, the ciphersuite labels have been abbreviated at least
to some extend to maintain the tradeoff between readability and length.</t>
      <t>The ciphersuite list above is a minimal starting point. Additional
ciphersuites can be registered into the already existing registry.
For example, once post-quantum cryptographic algorithms have been standardized
it might be beneficial to register ciphersuites for use with COSE-HPKE.
Additionally, ciphersuites utilizing the compact encoding of the public keys,
as defined in <xref target="I-D.irtf-cfrg-dnhpke"/>, may be standardized for use in
constrained environments.</t>
      <t>As a guideline for ciphersuite submissions to the IANA CoSE algorithm
registry, the designated experts must only register combinations of 
(KEM, KDF, AEAD) triple that consitute valid combinations for use with
HPKE, the KDF used should (if possible) match one internally used by the
KEM, and components should not be mixed between global and national standards.</t>

        <t>The COSE-HPKE algorithm uniquely determines the KEM for which a COSE_Key is used.

      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>This specification is based on HPKE and the security considerations of
<xref target="RFC9180"/> are therefore applicable also to this specification.</t>
      <t>HPKE assumes the sender is in possession of the public key of the recipient and
HPKE COSE makes the same assumptions. Hence, some form of public key distribution
mechanism is assumed to exist but outside the scope of this document.</t>
      <t>HPKE relies on a source of randomness to be available on the device. Additionally, 
with the two layer structure the CEK is randomly generated and it MUST be
ensured that the guidelines in <xref target="RFC8937"/> for random number generations are followed.</t>
      <t>HPKE in Base mode does not offer authentication as part of the HPKE KEM. In this
case COSE constructs like COSE_Sign, COSE_Sign1, COSE_MAC, or COSE_MAC0 can be
used to add authentication. HPKE also offers modes that offer authentication.</t>
      <t>If COSE_Encrypt or COSE_Encrypt0 is used with a detached ciphertext then the
subsequently applied integrity protection via COSE_Sign, COSE_Sign1, COSE_MAC, 
or COSE_MAC0 does not cover this detached ciphertext. Implementers MUST ensure
that the detached ciphertext also experiences integrity protection. This is, for
example, the case when an AEAD cipher is used to produce the detached ciphertext
but may not be guaranteed by non-AEAD ciphers.</t>

              <t>This document describes a scheme for hybrid public key encryption (HPKE). This scheme provides a variant of public key encryption of arbitrary-sized plaintexts for a recipient public key. It also includes three authenticated variants, including one that authenticates possession of a pre-shared key and two optional ones that authenticate possession of a key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) private key. HPKE works for any combination of an asymmetric KEM, key derivation function (KDF), and authenticated encryption with additional data (AEAD) encryption function. Some authenticated variants may not be supported by all KEMs. We provide instantiations of the scheme using widely used and efficient primitives, such as Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key agreement, HMAC-based key derivation function (HKDF), and SHA2.</t>

              <t>Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) is a data format designed for small code size and small message size. There is a need to be able to define basic security services for this data format. This document defines a set of algorithms that can be used with the CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) protocol (RFC 9052).</t>
              <t>This document, along with RFC 9052, obsoletes RFC 8152.</t>

              <abstract>
                <t>The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) is a data format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small code size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the need for version negotiation. These design goals make it different from earlier binary serializations such as ASN.1 and MessagePack.</t>

            <abstract>
              <t>Randomness is a crucial ingredient for Transport Layer Security (TLS) and related security protocols. Weak or predictable "cryptographically secure" pseudorandom number generators (CSPRNGs) can be abused or exploited for malicious purposes. An initial entropy source that seeds a CSPRNG might be weak or broken as well, which can also lead to critical and systemic security problems. This document describes a way for security protocol implementations to augment their CSPRNGs using long-term private keys. This improves randomness from broken or otherwise subverted CSPRNGs.</t>

              <t>   This document describes enhancements to the Hybrid Public Key
   Encryption standard published by CFRG.  These include use of "compact
   representation" of relevant public keys, support for key-wrapping,
   and two ways to address the use of HPKE on lossy networks: a
   determinstic, nonce-less AEAD scheme, and use of a rolling sequence
   number with existing AEAD schemes.
